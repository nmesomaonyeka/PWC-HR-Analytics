# Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard Analysis  

## Executive Summary  
As part of a project to assess diversity and inclusion metrics within an organization, an interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to analyze representation across key demographic segments. The dashboard provides insights into workforce composition, equity in promotions, and pay gaps, offering actionable recommendations to foster inclusivity. The analysis leverages employee demographics, performance evaluations, and salary distributions to guide strategic decision-making.
